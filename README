- Description:
	The program calculate the wins of Tic-Tac-Toe games read from files located in a directory
	path provided through the command line. Files contain game messages, which can be in two types:
	1. Move message - starts with a single letter designating X or O player’s move followed by
	   a pair of digits used to mark position on the board. A single space char is used as a
	   delimiter. So the move message should be in following format: "<player> <row> <column>".
	   Where <row> and <column> are numbers between 0 and 2.
    2. Reset message RST - brings the game to initial state.

	Messages are case insensitive and have to be separated by lines in files. After finished game
	(one side wins or draw), the game resets automatically, so each file can contain many games.
	
	All games, from all files will be played, and the final results will be written to single a
	RESULTS text file in same directory path provided through the command line, in the following
	format:
	X: <number of wins>
	O: <number of wins>
	D: <number of draws>

- Usage:
	.\Tic-Tac-Toe.exe <path>

	Where <path> is folder with files which will be read.
